## Usage

To use this project, run the command 'node index.js' in the terminal while in the root directory. </br>
After running node index.js, you will be prompted to answer a series of questions. </br>
Once the user has answered all of the questions, a new .md file named README will be generated. </br>
And that's it! Simple as that, now you can generate a professional README without going through the hassle of looking up what one looks like! </br>

This video will show you how to properly use the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FT4UsyyYfgMiX32CnBkubOZGeD78YjmF/view
